Web Component Demo
==================

Setting up the demo:

1. Clone this project down and run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start` to start a webpack dev server.  It will output a URL you can visit in your browser.

In `dist/index.html`, you will find the HTML for the page.  Components are loaded from `src/` and compiled via Webpack.
